When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you are working on the same files with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some changes might not be important enough to be saved in the repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: remote copy
clones: copy to local
branches: the "group" of commits you wanna clone/fork
You use fork when the changes are done in GitHub; clones when you want to copy something and the local is involved; branches is the location or "group of commits" you wanna clone
