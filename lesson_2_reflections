Reflections lesson 2

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
No commits are created. I don't know why..

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
You don't directly modify anything in the staging area and it is not a final version of what you want to commit in the respository
It offers the posibility to change the version of the files you want to commit before you do that
